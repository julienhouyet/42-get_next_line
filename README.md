# Introduction

The aim of this project is to make a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

At [42 School](https://github.com/42School), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), the school's coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.

## :zap: Usage

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

Compile your file with "get_next_line.c" and "get_next_line_utils.c". 

You can edit the BUFFER_SIZE with -D BUFFER_SIZE=number.
